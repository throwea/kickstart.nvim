Basics:
For loops
```
for var in [iterable] do
    [...insert_logic]
end
```

variables
```
var = <some_value>
local var = <some_value> //scopes the variable to the function/method/class it's defined in
```

Strings
```
print("text") -> way to print

string.format(<string>, elems...) -> same logic as formatting any other string in most languages
```

Neovim:

    Helpful neovim classes and methods

    - vim.fn.setreg(<register>, <string>) -> This will copy the desired string to desired register. You can take lua strings and copy them to system clipboard
    - vim.keymap.set(mode, binding, action, opts) -> basic keybinding method for neovim using lua
